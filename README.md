# Metric-Based In-Context Learning: A Case Study in Text Simplification

This is code for the implementation of the paper "Metric-Based In-Context Learning: A Case Study in Text Simplification."

In the code folder of the repository, you will find the code used to generate data for all of the experiments, including how to generate simplifications from GPT-3 (used in all of our example selection experiments) and our own implementation of KATE-GPT for optimized example selection.

In the output folder of the repository, you will find the results for all experiments that were explained in the paper. The results folder has several sub-folders, for the various experiments that were done. The names of the sub-folders correspond to the method of selecting examples. Each individual folder has its own README with more information on the files and folders inside. 

In the eval folder, the EASSE reports for each of the experiments are provided. The code and implementation of how to generate the EASSE reports is also provided, so you can replicate our SARI and BLEU scores in our results.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email subhavee2@gmail.com. Thank you!
