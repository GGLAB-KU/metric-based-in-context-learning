# Metric-Based In-Context Learning: A Case Study in Text Simplification

The following repository contains two pieces of information for each experiment run in our paper. 
1. We provide the original .txt files with the simplified text for ASSET, TurkCorpus, and FestAbility.
2. We provide the [EASSE](https://github.com/feralvam/easse) reports with information on the BLEU, SARI, and FKGL scores of each experiment.
⋅⋅* The EASSE reports are all found within [this folder](https://github.com/NLP-KU/metric-based-in-context-learning/tree/main/EASSE%20Reports)

The repository is organized by the experiments conducted.
