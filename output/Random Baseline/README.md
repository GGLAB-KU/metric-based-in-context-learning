Each subfolder contains the results of randomly selecting examples for prompting. We rerun this experiment 3 times to ensure robustness of our approach, and all results are provided in the subfolders. The Babbage subfolder contains results generated on the Babbage model, the Curie subfolder contains results generated on the Curie model, etc. The number at the end of each .txt file refers to the number of examples used when prompting.
