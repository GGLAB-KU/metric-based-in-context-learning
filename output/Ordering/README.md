This folder includes all of the ordering experiments. Two orderings other than lowest to highest were tested, including "Highest to Lowest" and "Random" orderings. In both of those folders, there are subfolders for both ASSET examples and TurkCorpus examples. The number at the end of the file indicates the number of examples that were used.
