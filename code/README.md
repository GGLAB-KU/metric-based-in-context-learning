The following folder contains the code used to run experiments.

auto_run.py - This code iteratively calls the GPT API and generates results for our experiments. You can run it directly and change the prompts and datasets to replicate our results.

KATE-GPT_Implementation.py - This code is an implementation for the KATE GPT algorithm. To run the code, simply provide your API key for OpenAI and input the dataset you want evaluation for on line 570. The code will automatically generate a .txt file with the simplifications.
